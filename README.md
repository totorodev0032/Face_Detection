# Face_Detection
Face detection using Viola-Jones algorithm
# Description
Viola-Jones takes an ensemble approach. Viola Jones uses many different classifiers, each looking at a different portion of the image. Each individual classifier is weaker i.e less accurate ,produces more false positives, than the final classifier because it is taking in less information. A strong classifier is made when weak classifiers are combined. It classifies images quickly because each weak classifier requires only a small number of parameters, and with a sufficient number of weak classifiers, it has a low rate of false positives. It has a large training period.
